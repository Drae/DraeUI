draePlates
==========

This is a nameplate addon for World for Warcraft. It's intended to compliment my draeFrames and other addons (but is not dependent on them). This is basically a mashup of existing nameplate addons (kuiNameplates, ElvUI and others), altered, updated and made to fit my liking. 

There is no in-game configuration for this addon. Everything is done via the config files, see those for more information.
